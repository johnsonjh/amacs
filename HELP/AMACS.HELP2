When you type M-X Add to History you are immediately promptedfor a reason.  The HISTORY library is asking you to give a short descriptionof the change that you have made to the current buffer.  This description isadded to the top of a file (default name CHANGE.HISTORY), along with otherinteresting information, such as the time that the change was made, yourusername, etc.
