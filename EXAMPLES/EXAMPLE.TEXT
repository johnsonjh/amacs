-*- Mode: Text -*-Hello, and thank you for using AMACS.  I would greatly appreciate anycomments, bug reports, or suggestions that you would like to give me.Please don't try to solve bugs by yourself.  There is over 1 meg of sourcecode involved in AMACS, and not all of it is simple.  Therefore, if AMACSshould "wedge" on you, or somehow otherwise break, the best way to get me tofix a possible bug is to send me a letter containing:	What the screen looked like at the time of wedging.	What the last 60 characters you typed were. If possible. 	If AMACS isn't completely wedged, (i.e. RESET gets you	back), then you should immediately type C-_ L, (or M-X What	Lossage), and write down what you see.	Where the cursor was in the file.  C-X = is the way to get	the most accurate info; if this isn't possible, try reading	the percent display in the far right hand edge of the	modeline.	What modes were active.M-X Indent Region is a powerful way to indent some lines an arbitrary amount. If no argument is given, it adds one character space to the indentation ofeach line in the region.  The above indented text was created by entering thetext with a fill column of 60, and then indenting that region with an argumentof 8.  Initially, this command is bound to Meta-I.
