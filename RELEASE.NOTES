(16-Oct-87)Bug reports should only be made for Version 3.0, Releases 2.2 and greater. The concept here is, any bug in an earlier version no longer exists.All requests, bug-reports, and non-consistency problems have been made to goaway.  These include:	* Indication of Auto File Extension when active.	* MERLIN Library enhanced to handle special cases.	* MAIL Library enhanced.	* Filename completion parsing!  Works when reading	  filenames.  This is great!  Spacebar or ESC complete	  the name.	* Fill Region always works perfectly now, regardless of	  what the region looks like.  It used to have trouble	  with carriage return characters that weren't part of	  the paragraph being filled.	* Fill commands take a numeric argument, which is the	  temporary value to use for Fill Column.  For example,	  you can type C-U 4 0 M-Q, and the current paragraph	  will be filled to 40 columns.  The value of Fill	  Column won't change.	* FILLPREFIX library flushed.  I managed to fit the	  code that performs the functionality into AMACS	  proper.  The function itself has changed to more	  closely match the original EMACS.  There is a string	  variable Fill Prefix which contains the current	  prefix for filling.  You set this variable with C-X .	  (Control-X Period).  It takes the contents of the line	  from the beginning up to Point and makes that the	  prefix.  Then fill commands will prepend the prefix	  on lines that wrap.  This is how this text is being	  typed in.	* Numeric arguments to keyboard macros.  Macro can be up	  to 512 characters in length.	* HISTORY library which helps you keep track of what	  files have been modified when, and for what reason.	* Obscure but deadly bug fix:	  If you filled up buffer space, and then visited a file	  which caused buffer space to be overflowed, and then	  switched buffers, and then typed text, AMACS let you	  insert characters.  Since there wasn't any buffer	  space left, you would lose very rapidly, and the	  entire contents of the buffer space could be lost.	  This is no longer possible.	* You can give Control-Meta-L (Flush Libraries) a	  numeric argument to bypass the prompt: Flush Libraries	  (Y/N)?.	  You can unload libararies from within an init file.	  Why is this important?  Because some libraries are	  designed specifically to give you access to internal	  variables of AMACS, and you can now "patch" your	  version on the fly.  Here is an example:;... init file commands...$setxor			[load the setxor library]XOR File Data Value:0	[load files the old way]$-			[get rid of this library]$history		[and load this winning one instead];---	* HC Top Line is no longer a "switch" variable.  It is a	  numeric one, and can take the following meaningful	  values:		0-127: No, don't print the top line.		128 or greater: Yes, print the top line.			128:   Page numbers on right side only.			129:   Page numbers on left side only.			255:   Even page numbers on left, odd on right.	* Obscure bug fix to printing:  The first line printed	  was affected incorrectly by the value in HC Left	  Margin.  This is no longer the case.	* Someone said that if you killed the "Main" buffer, and	  then continued to edit, eventually your AMACS would	  wedge on you.  If this could happen, it cannot happen	  now.	* If you were reading in the contents of a library file,	  and you were typing at the same time, the library	  could wedge on you.  This is no longer possible.	* Glen Bredon now allows the use of Tab characters in	  source files, in the soon to be released version of	  Merlin 16.  There will *very* soon be available a	  conversion program that converts APW Orca/M files to	  Merlin.	* Support has been added for libraries to implement	  their own modes.  This means that DIRED could have	  its own mode, and run in several buffers permanantly.	  This has not yet been implemented since you would	  have to have the library permenantly loaded.	* Giving C-X C-S (Save File) a numeric argument always	  makes it save the current buffer.  If the buffer	  hasn't been modified, the message: "No changes needed	  to be written." is displayed, but the buffer contents	  are written anyway.  If you don't give a numeric	  argument, and the buffer is unmodified, the original	  message "No changes need to be written." is displayed,	  and the buffer is not written.  C-X C-W as always can	  be used to write the buffer to a filename that you	  specify.	* Giving a numeric argument to the directory commands:	  M-X List Directory, C-X C-D (List Files) makes them	  prompt you for the directory to list.  You may use	  completion parsing on the directory name.	* You can unbind a key from any function within an	  init file.  You do this with the syntax:	  #Control-D::	  The secondary colon says to bind Control-D to do	  nothing, i.e. unbind it from its normal value.	* Giving a numeric argument to Load Library says to	  unload libraries first, a negative argument says not	  to prompt when you do it.   *********       *********       *********       *********       *********			If you are using an Apple IIgs:	* AMACS slows down the cursor by default to match the	  default blinker speed under a standard //e.  This	  translates to a value of 180.  This happens before	  your init file is read, so you can still set the	  blinker speed to something else in your init file.	* The arrow keys are read specially, allowing their use	  on the IIgs.  This means that you can type Control-U	  and get a numeric argument, and then type Right-Arrow	  and move right 4 characters.  Up-Arrow doesn't delete	  lines.	* Some internal names have changed:	  Altmode is echoed as Escape.	  The arrow keys echo as Left-Arrow, Right-Arrow, etc.	* Network support for the Corvus network (Const II) has	  been simplified.  There is a different system file.	  Network support for Apple's new network with file	  server is almost ready.  Awaiting name info from Apple.   *********       *********       *********       *********       *********	    	    Tasty Tidbits From Obscure Users (TTFOU)	* The above acronym is pronounced titty-foo, and	  reflects what happens to your screen when you use	  AMACS.Gordon Riggs:	"I placed Load Library on Meta-O (that is the letter	"O", not a zero) as kind of mnemonic for 'Oad Library.	I find that I am loading and flushing libraries with	increasing frequency now, and need to have Load Library	on a keystroke."(Gordon is a head programmer at the Bank Street Group (BSG), inCambridge, MA.  This group is responsible for the Bank StreetWriter, as well as other software.  The BSG has a site licensefor the use of AMACS.)Darach Foskett:	"While working on large projects, I need to keep close	track of the various revisions I make.  I use the	Insert Date and Time function to do so.  Since I use it	so often, I placed it on Control-Meta-T."(Darach is the head programmer at UNICOM's Software DevelopmentGroup (SDG) in Providence, RI.  The SDG is responsible fornetWORKS, The Network Manager's Toolkit, and most recently,//Write, a complete WYSIWYG word processor for the IIgs, and//e computers.  Darach has been using AMACS for over 2 years.) Brian Fox:	When using AMACS for editing program text, I like to place	Backward Kill Line on C-X Delete.  Naturally, I do this	in my init file.  I find that it provides a simple way	to delete the line of source that I had started to type,	without changing my mode of thought from "delete back to	line start" to "move to start of line and then delete".	I also place List Directory on C-X C-D, instead of the	default function: List Files.  I like seeing more	detailed information about the files rather than seeing	more files.  To each his own; this is why we have init	files.(Brian Fox is the author of AMACS.
